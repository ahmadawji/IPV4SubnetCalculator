# IPV4SubnetCalculator
IP version 4 subnet calculator helps CCNA students by calculating subnets for a given ip address and showing general information about each subnet.
For example when entering any ip address then setting how many bits you this ip to contain in the network part it will show how host can this network contain, moreover it will the
subnet mask for this network.
After you enter an ip address, you need to tell the program how many subnet do you need inside this network, which will then lead to show additional information about each subnet.
Information like:
1. The class of the original network
2. The host address range for each subnet 
3. Wildcard mask of each subnet 
4. The CIDR notation for the network
